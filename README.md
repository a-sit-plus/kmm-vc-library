This [Kotlin Mulitplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) library implements the [W3C VC Data Model](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) to support several use cases of verifiable credentials, verifiable presentations, and validation thereof. This library may be shared between Wallet Apps, Verifier Apps and a Backend Service issuing credentials.

## Architecture

This library was built with [Kotlin Mulitplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) and [Mulitplatform Mobile](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/) in mind. Its primary targets are JVM, Android and iOS. In order to achieve smooth usage especially under iOS, there have been some notable design decisions:

 - Code interfacing with client implementations uses the return type `KmmResult` to transport the `Success` case (i.e. a custom data type) as well as potential errors from native implementations as a `Failure`.
 - Native implementations can be plugged in by implementing interfaces, e.g. `CryptoService`, as opposed to callback functions.
 - Use of primitve data types for constructor properties instead of e.g. kotlinx datetime types.
 - This library provides some "default" implementations, e.g. `DefaultCryptoService` to test as much code as possible from the `commonMain` module.
 - Some classes feature additional constructors or factory methods with a shorter argument list because the default arguments are lost when called from Swift.
 
Notable features for mulitplatform are:

 - Use of [Napier](https://github.com/AAkira/Napier) as the logging framework
 - Use of [Kotest](https://kotest.io/) for unit tests
 - Implementation of a BitSet in pure Kotlin, see `KmmBitSet`
 - Implementation of a ZLIB service in Kotlin with native parts, see `ZlibService`
 - Implementation of JWS and JWE operations in pure Kotlin (delegating to native crypto), see `JwsService`
 - Abstraction of several cryptographic primitives, to be implemented in native code, see `CryptoService`

The main entry point for applications is an instance of `HolderAgent`, `VerifierAgent` or `IssuerAgent`, according to the nomenclature from the [W3C VC Data Model](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/).

We implement protocols for issuing credentials and presenting proofs from ARIES, i.e. [ARIES RFC 0453 Issue Credential V2](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2) and [ARIES RFC 0454 Present Proof V2](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0454-present-proof-v2). A single run of a protocol is implemented by the `*Protocol` classes, whereas the `*Messenger` classes should be used by applications to manage several runs of a protocol. These classes reside in the artifact `vclib-aries`.

There is also a simple implementation of [Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html), see `OidcSiopProtocol`. In addition, [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) has been implemented, see `at.asitplus.wallet.lib.oidvci.WalletService` in the artifact `vclib-openid`.

Many classes define several constructor parameters, some of them with default values, to enable a simple form of dependency injection. Implementers are advised to specify the parameter names of arguments passed to increase readability and prepare for future extensions.

## Limitations

 - For Verifiable Credentials and Presentations, only the JWT proof mechanism is implemented.
 - Json Web Keys always use a `kid` of `did:key:mEpA...` with a custom, uncompressed representation of `secp256r1` keys.
 - Several parts of the W3C VC Data Model have not been fully implemented, i.e. everything around resolving cryptographic material.
 - Cryptographic operations are implemented for EC cryptography on the `secp256r1` curve to fully support hardware-backed keys on Android and iOS. However, the enum classes for cryptographic primitives may be extended to support other algorithms.

## iOS Implementation

The `DefaultCryptoService` for iOS should not be used in production as it does not implement encryption, decryption, key agreement and message digests correctly. See the [Swift Package](https://github.com/a-sit-plus/swift-package-kmm-vc-library) for details on a more correct iOS implementation.

## Credentials

A single credential itself is an instance of `CredentialSubject` and has no special meaning attached to it. This library implements `AtomicAttribute2023` as a sample of a custom credential.

Other libraries using this library may subclass `CredentialSubject` and call `LibraryInitializer.registerExtensionLibrary()` to register that extension with this library:

```kotlin
@kotlinx.serialization.Serializable
@kotlinx.serialization.SerialName("YourCredential2023")
class YourCredential : at.asitplus.wallet.lib.data.CredentialSubject {
    // custom properties
    @SerialName("firstname")
    val firstname: String
    
    constructor(id: String, firstname: String) : super(id = id) {
        this.firstname = firstname
    }
    
    override fun toString(): String {
        return "YourCredential(id='$id', firstname='$firstname')"
    }
}

at.asitplus.wallet.lib.LibraryInitializer.registerExtensionLibrary(
    at.asitplus.wallet.lib.LibraryInitializer.ExtensionLibraryInfo(
        credentialScheme = object : at.asitplus.wallet.lib.data.ConstantIndex.CredentialScheme {
            override val credentialDefinitionName: String = "yourcredential"
            override val schemaUri: String = "https://example.com/schemas/1.0.0/yourcredential.json"
            override val vcType: String = "YourCredential2023"
        },
        serializersModule = kotlinx.serialization.modules.SerializersModule {
            kotlinx.serialization.modules.polymorphic(CredentialSubject::class) {
                kotlinx.serialization.modules.subclass(YourCredential::class)
            }
        },
    )
)
```
